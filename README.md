## Introduction

This repository is an archive of the 2024 tomato inoculant project I performed as part of my Master's of Science in Integrative Biology at Kennesaw State University.

The trial was conducted with the purpose of determining the effects of differing soil microbial inoculation timings on tomato plant photosynthesis and crop yield and quality. Photosynthesis metrics were taken with a Li-COR Li-600 and two PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2.0s, and include stomatal conductance 
**(gsw)**, measured in (mol m-2 s-1), which is a measure of how well the leaf is able to conduct gas through its stomates, and the efficiency of photosystem II **(PhiPS2)**, where photosystem II is a piece of machinery in the chloroplast essential to photosynthesis and PhiPS2 is the quantum yield in light calculated from fluorescence.

Sample size **(n=48)** with 4 groups, 12 replicates per group. The tomato plants were grown in a dutch bucket hydroponic system from May to October 2024. Fluorometric measurements were taken twice weekly, and fruit were harvested upong fully ripening and taken back to the lab on the KSU campus for analysis.

Fruit analysis included weighing the tomato for its **mass** in grams and visually assessing it for blossom end rot **(BER)**, a nutritional disorder caused by calcium deficiency that renders the fruit unmarketable, as well as visual checks for **fungus** and **cracking**. Fungus commonly appears on parts of the tomato with blossom end rot or cracking. From there, fruit were analyzed with a penetrometer for **ripeness**, (1-kg) where kg is mapped from 0:1, and then with Fisher Brix Refractometers for **sugar concentration** in percent sugar content of the tomato's juice.

Discarded fruit were then composted.
